1. Hours to complete the project: 6 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Ring Buffer):It was hard to understand the concept of the ring buffer
and confusing to know how it works, but after I read the questions and see the
descriptions for each function I understand to add and remove elements in each
function. I also, after seeing some examples that we did in class about frequency, 
that helps too. The TA also go over the problems and helped us to know how to peek
function works. 

    Problem 2 (Guitar String):Knowing the difference between creating and create from 
a sample was very confusing, I was keeping getting errors because I did not know where
to create an object string and init in the functions, but after I see the example that 
the professor gives in the class about adding blocks in the open box and how to deal 
waves utilizing a recursive model. It gives me an idea to solve the problem Guitar string.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------
    
     N/A               TA    Go over the problems and explains about the functions.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Accually, project 3 is more clear and well diffined than the rest of other problems 
because It is well defined and each function that we have to in the problems had enough
discription, so it was challenging, but also it was fun to solve it.
