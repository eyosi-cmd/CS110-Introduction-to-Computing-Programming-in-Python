1. Hours to complete the project: 14 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Particle Identification): I know to calculate avogadro number, 
          I used the formula from the discription, however the program that I
          written it is not working, i do not know why?
            
   Problem 2 (Particle Tracking): Solving this problem is very hard.I try to 
          determine how far a bead would moved from one time step t to the other,
         but the program that I write is not working. 
   Problem 3 (Data Analysis):Analizing the data does not work.
