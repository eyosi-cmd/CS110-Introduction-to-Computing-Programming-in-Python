1. Hours to complete the project: 48+ hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Markov Model Data Type): I think its the most difficult project that I encountered from this class.
   However, I try to solve the problem by applying the discription that is given what each Data Types do. I created
   a Markov model in order k in the model. The hints that given what the Markov model do is helpful to solve the problem
   because I apply that utilizing the model thatpredicts the occurace of letter in the alphabet.

   Problem 2 (Random Text Generator): After understanding the Markov model, it wasn't hard to generate a random text.
   The only diffult thing is understanding what sys.stdin.read() do, but after attending one of the dissuction section 
   I was able to get a help from the TA what this problem is asking.
   

   Problem 3 (Noisy Message Decoder): It was confusing to know how Message Decoding work since its accessing the obama dic file
   to do so, however the given example on the problem shit helps alot on understand what the problem do which is replacing char
   that makes sense, and the example is prefect. I used it Markov model to input the files.
position (given the previous characters) but also when the replacement is used in the context of the k
3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

 It was challenging problem, it took me long time to solve it but overall it was fun.
